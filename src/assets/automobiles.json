    "description1": "The esteemed RS badge has migrated to SUVs and, in more recent times, electric cars as well, but fast estates like the A4 Avant is where Audi’s performance heritage really started. Roominess, all-weather four-wheel drive and a thumping 600 horsepower engine play to A4 tradition but this latest one is also impressively luxurious and would make the perfect accompaniment to a fleet of supercars if you want your daily driver as fast as it is discreet. It’s priced accordingly and remains a somewhat quirky choice, but recognition has grown beyond its cult following and wider appreciation of the A4’s talents have earned plaudits across the board, not least in the 2022 Auto Trader New Car Awards where you awarded it the title of Best Luxury Car. A verdict we’d wholeheartedly agree with!",

Behind the restyled grille and headlight arrangement are new petrol and diesel engines, all with a mild electrical boost in an effort to keep running costs reasonable, all things relative. It also gets BMW’s latest widescreen digital dashboard and a ton of tech. While just as massive on the road it’s hard to ignore the fact the Range Rover or Defender you might also be considering do all of this with dose more style and, for UK roads, an X5 has most of the appeal in a more manageable package. But if size matters the X7 remains an impressive piece of kit and feels fresher than the equivalently huge Mercedes GLS.",

    "subtitle": "While it lacks the full electric option of some rivals the Ford Fiesta is best small hatchbacks ..",
    "description1": "There’s a very good reason why the Ford Fiesta is one of the UK’s most popular small cars, on the basis it’s quite simply one of the best on the market. Not only is it efficient and high-tech enough to compete with its rivals on every level, it’s also more enjoyable to drive. The boot may look a little small on paper, but it’s still more than practical enough for most customers’ needs and the build quality is excellent. Now updated, the Fiesta gets the usual updates of a revised grille (the bigger Ford badge taking pride of place in the centre) and much improved tech via a standard central touch-screen. Those looking for more space might prefer the Seat Ibiza or Skoda Fabia, both of which are roomy and keenly priced, but the Fiesta offers a much more engaging and entertaining driving experience.",

No surprise there, given the previous GLC was a huge success for Mercedes, a massive hit with buyers and has grown into the most popular model in the firm’s extensive range As Alex discovers, the new GLC simply offers more of everything. More space, more tech, more style and more of the luxury Mercedes buyers expect.Sharing much with the latest version of the popular C-Class saloon, the biggest changes in the GLC can be found inside, where on higher grade models a giant, ‘floating’ screen seemingly hovers over the centre of the dashboard and is your main point of interaction with the tech powering the car. This is paired with a digital instrument cluster and your choice of control, be that through voice or touch.Practicality is an important consideration for SUV customers as well, Alex checking out the extra space in the rear Mercedes has included, while also enjoying some of the premium fixtures and fittings throughout.",
